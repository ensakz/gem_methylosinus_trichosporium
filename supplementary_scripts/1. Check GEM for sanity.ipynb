    "NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenase from M. trichosporium OB3b has been purified and characterized (Jollie and Lipscomb, 1991). The enzyme is composed of four subunit types and contained flavin, iron, and molybdenum (Jollie and Lipscomb, 1991). The genome of M. trichosporium OB3b predicts one NAD-dependent molybdenum-containing formate dehydrogenase encoded by fdsABGCD and an additional single copy of the alpha subunit (fdhA). The two genes fdsA and fdhA share 81% identity. Only one of them, fdsA as well as the rest of the fds cluster genes were expressed in the transcriptome\" --> I think there is no way how I can constrain NADH, NADPH metabolism.\n",
